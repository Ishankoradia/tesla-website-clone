## Objective
Get hands on and see how redux works with react JS

## Learning  
- Learned state-management with redux.
- Got introduced to react-reveal to create cool animations with a very simple syntax. https://www.react-reveal.com/examples/common/fade/ this is an example of how simple it is to create simple animation effects with react-reveal
- Learned about organizing react components for better reusability. For example, the teals website has a home page where the page scrolls down to showcase different products. Instead of repeating the sections on home page, its better to create a component section.js and pass props to it. So that in future if you want to add another component just define the required props.

## Technologies used
- React JS
- react-reveal for animation
- redux for state management.
